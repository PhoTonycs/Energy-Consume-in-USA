The purpose of this work is to obatin a good model which can be useful for predictions or forecasting in a Energy-Consume in the West of the USA.
This project has two main parts:
- Failled models.
- Accurate models.

In the first part of the project there will be models like polynomials and cubic piece-wise functions, where those models failed badly for forecasting.
The second part consists in using *Time-Series* to get the right and best model. All popular models like ARMA, ARIMA, ARCH, etc, will be shown and comapre in order to get the best one of them.

I added a binder bottom to have this project in a lab.
